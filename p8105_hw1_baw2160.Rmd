# Problem One:

## Creating a data frame 

It contains one random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0, 5] distribution, one logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2, one character vector of length 10, and one factor vector of length 10:

```{r problem_1_data_frame}
prob1_df = tibble(
  unif_samp = runif(10, 0, 5),
  
  vec_logic = unif_samp > 2,
  
  vec_char = c("I", "just", "made", "this", "a", "character", "vector", "of", "size", "ten"),
  
  vec_factor = factor(c("dog", "cat", "cat", "dog", "dog", "dog", "bird", "cat", "dog", "cat"))
)
```

## Taking the mean
Attempting to take the mean of each variable in my date frame:
```{r problem_1_means}
colMeans(prob1_df)
```
